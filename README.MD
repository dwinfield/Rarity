<p>Rarity tracks how many times you've tried to obtain various rare items like mounts, battle pets, and toys. It will tell you how likely you are to obtain the item, track how long you've been farming for it, and tell you how lucky you've been so far. Although it's mostly used for mounts, battle pets, and toys, it supports pretty much any item, including profession patterns, archaeology projects, and more.</p>

<p>Out of the box, Rarity includes support for every single mount, battle pet, and toy in the game which require some time to farm. It also includes support for some mount-related items like <a href="http://www.wowhead.com/item=86547">Skyshard</a>, <a href="http://www.wowhead.com/item=94295">Primal Egg</a>, and <a href="http://www.wowhead.com/item=94288">Giant Dinosaur Bone</a>. It'll even notice if you mouseover a <a href="http://www.wowhead.com/npc=50410">Mysterious Camel Figurine</a>, plus lots of other stuff. Rarity factors in the size of a typical group when determining probabilities, and can also tell you if you've killed various bosses this week (or day). Holiday just started, and you didn't notice? Rarity will give you a helpful reminder to run those holiday dungeons or daily quests if you still need an item from them.</p>
<p>If Rarity doesn't track something you want to track, you can add it yourself! Just about everything is user configurable.</p>
<p>Curious what math is going on behind the scenes? The author of <a href="http://www.curse.com/addons/wow/bunny-hunter">Bunny Hunter</a> created the original algorithms. <a href="http://www.iamcal.com/beating-the-rng/">He wrote an article about it here.</a> Your chance to obtain an item doesn't increase as you farm it; Rarity is just telling you how lucky you've been so far. It can be remarkably cathartic to see a progress bar move up as you spend hours upon hours trying for that <a href="http://www.wowhead.com/item=20769">Disgusting Oozeling</a>.</p>

<li>Provides a progress bar, which you can toggle by clicking the icon or feed label.</li>
<li>Adds info to NPC and item tooltips, showing you if it drops or contains something that Rarity tracks. Rare mobs with a guaranteed drop show which item they drop and if you've defeated them yet.</li>
